    "answer": "Initial Quantity On Hand refers to the quantity of an item you already have in stock as of a specific date when you begin using Book Keeper.

    "question": "What is Initial Cost/Unit?",
    "answer": "Initial Cost/Unit is the per unit cost of an item as of the date you begin using Book Keeper. It typically represents the average purchase price of the item, excluding tax. For example, if you have 500 units of an item in stock and each unit was purchased at an average rate of INR50, you should enter INR50 as the Initial Cost/Unit. This value is used to calculate the total value of opening stock, which is then reflected in your Profit & Loss statement and other financial reports. It is important to note that this field is not linked to the Default Purchase Price."

    "id": "GEN52",
    "question": "What is Default Sale Price?",
    "answer": "Default Sale Price is the standard rate at which you intend to sell an item. When you select this item while creating a sales invoice, this price is automatically prefilled, making the billing process faster and more consistent. You can update the Default Sale Price at any time if your selling price changes, and all future invoices will reflect the updated rate. However, it’s important to note that changing this value does not affect past invoices, does not impact your Profit & Loss statement or other financial reports directly. The actual profit is calculated based on the rate used at the time of transaction, not the default rate. In summary, Default Sale Price is a convenience setting, not a financial reporting field."

    "id": "GEN53",
    "question": "What is Default Purchase Price?",
    "answer": "Default Purchase Price is the standard rate at which you generally purchase an item. When you create a purchase entry in Book Keeper and select the item, this price is automatically prefilled to streamline data entry. It is not linked to the Initial Cost/Unit. It serves as a reference value and can be changed at the time of actual purchase. It does not impact the Balance Sheet, Profit & Loss statement, or any other financial reports. Updating this price will only affect future purchase entries, not past ones. In essence, Default Purchase Price is a convenience tool to speed up purchase recording and maintain consistency, but it does not influence financial outcomes or profitability directly."

    "question": "What is Multiple Pricing? How to enable and use it?",
    "answer": "Multiple Pricing allows you to maintain up to 7 different price levels for a single item based on the type of customer you are dealing with.
